            <p>Current forms of travel are such a hassle. Automotive problems pop up all the time and petroleum prices are way too high for the common man.

By using our advanced patented technology you can propel your vehicle forward without turning a key twice. Keep in mind, you won't be able to go backwards or stop. Wait a minute... this is just a magnet </p>
